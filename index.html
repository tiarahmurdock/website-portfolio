            <p class="about-me-content">Hi, I'm Tiarah Murdock, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building practical, user-friendly websites. I’m currently learning the fundamentals of web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What started as curiosity quickly became a deep interest in how technology shapes our everyday lives—and now I’m committed to turning that interest into a career.

                Right now, I’m working on my first personal website, which I’m designing from scratch to showcase my learning journey and projects. I’m experimenting with layout design, responsive elements, and basic interactivity to create a simple but polished site. I’ve also been exploring how to integrate images and other media to make the site more engaging, all while learning best practices for file structure, performance, and accessibility.
                
                Beyond coding, I’m excited about the problem-solving side of software engineering. I love breaking down challenges into smaller, manageable pieces and figuring out how everything fits together. In the future, I hope to contribute to meaningful projects that make tech more accessible and intuitive for everyone. For now, I’m focused on learning as much as I can—and having fun while doing it.</p>
